Python is primarily known as an interpreted language. This means that Python code is executed line-by-line by an interpreter at runtime, rather than being compiled into machine code beforehand.

However, it's worth noting that Python is often described as a "high-level language" and uses a combination of both compilation and interpretation techniques:

1. **Compilation**: When you run a Python script, the Python interpreter first compiles the code into bytecode, which is a lower-level, platform-independent representation of the code. This bytecode is then interpreted by the Python virtual machine (PVM) to execute the code.

2. **Interpretation**: The Python interpreter reads and executes the bytecode. This allows for interactive programming and immediate feedback, which is a hallmark of interpreted languages.

So while Python uses an interpreter for execution, it also involves a compilation step to convert the code into bytecode.
