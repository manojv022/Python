Python is primarily known as an interpreted language. This means that Python code is executed line-by-line by an interpreter at runtime, rather than being compiled into machine code beforehand.

However, it's worth noting that Python is often described as a "high-level language" and uses a combination of both compilation and interpretation techniques:

1. **Compilation**: When you run a Python script, the Python interpreter first compiles the code into bytecode, which is a lower-level, platform-independent representation of the code. This bytecode is then interpreted by the Python virtual machine (PVM) to execute the code.

2. **Interpretation**: The Python interpreter reads and executes the bytecode. This allows for interactive programming and immediate feedback, which is a hallmark of interpreted languages.

So while Python uses an interpreter for execution, it also involves a compilation step to convert the code into bytecode.


# what is Compiler and Interpreter:

**Compilers** and **interpreters** are both tools used to process and execute code, but they do so in different ways:

### Compiler

- **Function**: A compiler translates the entire source code of a program into machine code (or intermediate code) all at once. This machine code is then executed by the computer's hardware directly.
  
- **Process**: The process involves several stages, including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation.
  
- **Execution**: Once the compilation is complete, the program can be executed multiple times without needing to be recompiled.
  
- **Advantages**:
  - **Performance**: Compiled programs generally run faster because they are directly executed by the hardware.
  - **Optimization**: Compilers often optimize code to improve performance.
  
- **Disadvantages**:
  - **Compilation Time**: The compilation process can be time-consuming, especially for large programs.
  - **Error Detection**: Errors are detected during the compilation process, meaning you need to fix all errors before running the program.

- **Examples**: C, C++, Rust, and Go are typically compiled languages.

### Interpreter

- **Function**: An interpreter reads and executes the source code line-by-line or statement-by-statement. It translates each line into machine code on-the-fly and executes it immediately.

- **Process**: The interpreter processes the code in a more incremental fashion, converting it into machine code at runtime.

- **Execution**: Interpreted programs require the interpreter to be present and run every time the program is executed.
  
- **Advantages**:
  - **Ease of Testing**: Interpreters allow for rapid testing and debugging because you can run and test code incrementally.
  - **Platform Independence**: The same code can often run on different platforms as long as the interpreter is available.

- **Disadvantages**:
  - **Performance**: Interpreted programs can be slower because the code is parsed and executed in real-time.
  - **No Pre-Execution Optimization**: There's usually less opportunity for optimizing code before execution.

- **Examples**: Python, Ruby, JavaScript, and PHP are typically interpreted languages.

### Hybrid Approaches

Some languages use a combination of both compilation and interpretation techniques. For example:

- **Java**: Java code is first compiled into bytecode by the Java compiler, and then this bytecode is interpreted or further compiled into machine code by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

- **Python**: Python code is first compiled into bytecode, which is then interpreted by the Python Virtual Machine.

This hybrid approach can offer a balance between the performance of compiled languages and the flexibility of interpreted ones.
