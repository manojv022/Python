- ####  To represent the data in python programing we require 3 things:
- 1. Litrals/Values
 - 2. Data type
  - 3. Identifiers/Variables/Object

### Literals: 
- literals are nothing but input values passing to the program.
- foe eg : 1. Numeric literals
           2. Boolean literals
           3. String literals

  - All the Literals are Stored in main memoey by allocating sufficient amount of memory by the help of data types.

### Variables:
- a Variables is an Identifer , whose valuescan be changed during execution of the program.
- All the Variables in Python are called Objects.
- Behind of all Objects, there exist a class

#### Rules for using variables :
- A variable name is a combination of abphabets,digits and a special symbol Underscore(_).
- The first letter of variable names must start with alphabet or underscore.
- within the variables name , special symbols ae not allowed except underscore.
- No keywords to be used as variables name because all the keywords are special meaning to the language compilers.
- all pre-defined class names(int,float,etc) acn be used as variable names.
- All the variable name as case-sensitive
