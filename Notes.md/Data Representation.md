- ####  To represent the data in python programing we require 3 things:
- 1. Litrals/Values
 - 2. Data type
  - 3. Identifiers/Variables/Object

### Literals: 
- literals are nothing but input values passing to the program.
- foe eg : 1. Numeric literals
           2. Boolean literals
           3. String literals

  - All the Literals are Stored in main memoey by allocating sufficient amount of memory by the help of data types.

### Variables:
- a Variables is an Identifer , whose valuescan be changed during execution of the program.
- All the Variables in Python are called Objects.
- Behind of all Objects, there exist a class
