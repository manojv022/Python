#### int data type: 
- we can use it data type to represent whole numbers whole number/integae values are nothing but data without decimal places. for eg, a=100.
     
- with `int` data type, we can also store number system data.
- in any programin language(python,C,C++,java), we have 4 types of Number systems they are,
   - 1. Decimal number system(Default) (0123456789) , [Base=10]
    - 2. Binary number system(0,1)
     - 3. Octal Number system (01234567)
    - 4. Hexa decimal number system(0123456789A(11),B(12),C(13),D(14),E(15),F(16) , hexadecimal ( 0x or 0X ) .   


#### Binary Number System: 
- the digit in binary number system are digits: (0,1).
- Base:2
- To store binary data in python programing, binary data must be preceded with either ( 0b or 0B).
#### Octal Number system:
- The digits in octal number system are Digits: ( 01234567 )
- Base:8
- To store octal  data in python programing , octal data must be preceded with  ( 0o or 0O ).

### Base Conversion:
- The purpose of base conversion technique in python is that "ccconverting one base value into another base value".
- In python, we have 3 base conversion function they are :
   - 1. bin()
   - 2. oct()
   - 3. hex()
- 1. bin() : this funcction is used for converting other number system data into binary number system.
   
 - 2. oct(): this function is used for converting other number system data into Octal number system.
