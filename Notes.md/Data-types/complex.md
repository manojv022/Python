### Complex Data Type:
- `Complex` is one of the pre-defined class and treated as fundamental data type.
- The purpose of complex data type is that "to store imaginary data complex numbers".
- The general format of complex number is shown below. ; a+bj or a-bj
- Here `a` is called real part `b` is called imaginary part and `j` is (in root -1).

- To get real and imaginary parts from coplex object we use two pre-defined attributies they are
   - `1. real`
   - `2. imag`
